# Impressionist

This app is an impressionist art creation application. It works by loading a picture from your gallery (also provides an option to pull other images from a specified location) and gives you the option to make it like the works of Van Gogh.

# How to run

Just build the project in Android Studio and build on your device/emulator.

Select an image, then a brush type and then select whether or not you want the size to change dynamically.

It's that simple! Have fun!
